# Blitz-AI-ENABLED-SMART-TRAFFIC-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM-FOR-URBAN-CONGESTION
# 🚦 **AI-Powered Smart Traffic Management System**

## 🔍 **OVERVIEW**
The **AI-Powered Smart Traffic Management System** is an advanced solution designed to optimize urban traffic flow using **computer vision, machine learning, and algorithmic optimization**. This system efficiently detects vehicles, dynamically adjusts traffic signals, and provides real-time visualization to improve road efficiency and reduce congestion.

## 🚗 **KEY MODULES**

### 1️⃣ **VEHICLE DETECTION**
- Utilizes **YOLOv7**, a cutting-edge object detection model, to identify vehicles from real-time camera feeds.
- Processes images and video streams to count and classify vehicles.
- Provides accurate traffic density estimation for decision-making.

### 2️⃣ **INTELLIGENT SIGNAL CONTROL**
- Dynamically adjusts traffic light durations based on real-time vehicle detection data.
- Considers traffic patterns, historical data, and lane configurations.
- Minimizes waiting times and optimizes intersection throughput.

### 3️⃣ **REAL-TIME VISUALIZATION**
- A **graphical interface (GUI)** powered by **Pygame** to display traffic signal changes.
- Provides live updates on vehicle count and signal status.
- Helps monitor and analyze traffic patterns effectively.

## 🎯 **FEATURES**
✅ **Real-time vehicle detection** with **YOLOv7**  
✅ **Adaptive traffic signal timing** to reduce congestion  
✅ **Interactive traffic visualization** for better monitoring  
✅ **Optimized traffic flow**, leading to smoother movement  
✅ **Developed using Python, OpenCV, Pygame, and Deep Learning**  

## 🛠️ **TECH STACK**
